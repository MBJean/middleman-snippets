# Middleman snippets

I’m a big fan of Middleman. I’ve built [my website](http://davidl.fr) on it, as well as [foundation boilerplate](https://github.com/flexbox/foundation-boilerplate) and [advices for good scalable css](http://guidecss.fr). This repository serves as a library of commonly used Middleman snippets.

## Contents

### Posts

- [List of posts](posts-list.html) for archive or condensed index pages.

### Pages

- [Navigation with active class](pages-nav.html) for linking pages with the `layout: page`.

### Layout

- [Page title with site title fallback](layout-page-title.html)

### Data

- [List of items](data-list.html) from a particular `.yml` file in the `/data` directory.

### Time

- [Current year](time-current-year.html.slim) for things like copyright.
- [Current date](time-month-day-year.html.slim) as full month, day, and year.
